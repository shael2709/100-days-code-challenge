1. Take an array of positive and negative integers. Find if their is a sub array with sum zero exists or not. If exists, then return that subarray.

2. We have a binary array [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], we need to sort it as [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. But we need to sort it in O(n) time.

3. We have an array [3, 0, 1, 0, 5, 9, 0, 6, 7]. We need push all the zeros to end [3, 1, 5, 9, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0]. But we need to maintain the relative order of all the items inside array.
